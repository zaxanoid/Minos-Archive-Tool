G8ZAX Minos Archive tool. 
Allows multiple .cls, .edi and .minos files for be combined into an archive file


I wrote this because I could not find anything which did exactly what I wanted.
It appears to work, and I have used it to create an archive file from over 100 Minos database files in one go. 
Solved my problem, but ....
It is badly written, has very few comments and is "as is". I am not a python programmer, but I am learning. 
I am releasing this here in case it is of use to you.
